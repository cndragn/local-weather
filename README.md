<h2>Objective/User Stories:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV</li>
<li>Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style</li>
<li>User Story: I can see the weather in my current location</li>
<li>User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather</li>
<li>User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius</li>
<li>We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather</li>
<li>Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck</li>
<li>When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen</li>
<li>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook</li>
</ul>
